This Flask-based REST API uses Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy to manage a simple user database. It defines a UserModel with id, name, and email fields, ensuring uniqueness for both name and email. The API provides two main resources: UserList for listing and creating users, and User for retrieving, updating, or deleting a user by ID.

Using request parsing (reqparse), the API validates incoming data, returning appropriate HTTP status codes. For instance, if a user already exists, it returns 409 Conflict, and for missing records, it returns 404 Not Found.

Marshalling is handled via fields and marshal_with to ensure consistent JSON output. SQLAlchemy handles all ORM operations, and IntegrityError is caught to manage DB exceptions gracefully.

The app exposes routes like /api/users/ for GET (all users) and POST (create), and /api/users/<id> for GET, PATCH, and DELETE operations on specific users. The database is created via db.create_all() using app.app_context().

This setup showcases a clean, modular REST API architecture in Flask, ready to be extended or deployed.
